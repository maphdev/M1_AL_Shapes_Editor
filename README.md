# Shapes Editor

Software Engineering project for the ["*Software Architecture*"](https://github.com/maphdev/M1_Software_Architecture) course at the University of Bordeaux, France.

## Instructions

Implement a geometric figure editor with Java and the different Design Patterns seen in class.

This geometric figure editor must implement the following functionnalities :
- Select an object from a toolbar, and position it on a whiteboard using drag and drop.
- Create object groups and object subgroups, sub-subgroups etc... 
- Dissociate an object group.
- Modify the size, position, etc... of our objects or groups of objects once they are incorporated into the drawing.
- Add groups of objects or parameterized objects to our toolbar by dropping them on the toolbar (drag and drop).
- Cancel or redo an operation.
- Save a document and load a document.
- Save the software status (toolbar) and reload it at startup.
